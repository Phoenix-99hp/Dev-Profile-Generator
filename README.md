# Dev-Profile-Generator

https://phoenix-99hp.github.io/Dev-Profile-Generator/

This is a command line profile generator. It prompts the user for their GitHub username and a color through Inquirer. With that information, an api call is made to GitHub, and information is received and used to fill out a developer profile. The background of the profile will change depending on which color the user selects in the command line. Finally, HTML-PDF is used to create a pdf of the developer's profile.
